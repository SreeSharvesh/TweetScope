# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets Using NLP

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets from X (formerly Twitter) based on sentiment. The model categorizes tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into social media trends and aiding decision-making.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Analyzes tweets and labels them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and handling of emojis and hashtags for clean and accurate data.
- **High Model Accuracy**: Achieves optimal performance through fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Supports real-time sentiment analysis and visualization for monitoring social media trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Offers dashboards and visualizations to present analysis results effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - NLP: NLTK, SpaCy
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Web Framework: Streamlit (in progress)
- **Tools**: Tweepy (for data collection), Jupyter Notebook, Git
